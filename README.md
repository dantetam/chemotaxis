chemotaxis
==========

A project for AP Computer Science to practice with OOP

Chemotaxis is the reaction of bacteria to an outside stimulus. This project simulates the movement of bacteria (blue) in an environment with food (green). Make a bacteria class, make an array to hold all the bacteria, and then loop through the bacteria and draw them with Processing functions.
